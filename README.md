# Borrower-Risk-Assessment
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for loan default using machine learning techniques on a historical loan dataset. The model is evaluated with cross-validation and various performance metrics to determine its efficacy in accurately assessing credit risk for loan applications.

## Data
The data used in this project is a historical loan dataset that includes information about borrower characteristics (e.g., credit score, income, employment history) and loan information (e.g., loan amount, interest rate, default status). The data was obtained from a publicly available source and has been preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

**Dataset overview:**

| Label | Description | Instances
| --- | --- | --- | 
|0| Repaid the loan | 33136 |
|1| Defaulted | 5634 |
