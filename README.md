# Borrower-Risk-Assessment
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for loan default using machine learning techniques on a historical loan dataset. The model is evaluated with cross-validation and various performance metrics to determine its efficacy in accurately assessing credit risk for loan applications.

# Data
The data used in this project is a historical loan dataset that includes information about borrower characteristics (e.g., credit score, income, employment history) and loan information (e.g., loan amount, interest rate, default status). The data was obtained from a publicly available source and has been preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

Some assumtions for the dataset:

| Encoding | Status | Data
| --- | --- | --- | 
|0| Paid back loan | 25474 |
|1| Defaulted | 7109 |
